# DufflinMunder

This was our first group project in the Backend part of our NSS bootcamp. 

## Individual Contributions
My specific contributions included working on the Accountant Sales Report (#2) and the ability to find a sale (#4). 
For both features, I gave the user the ability to select users by ID to keep data entry more accurate than if one were to type a name. 
In the process of validating the user's entry, I discovered the TryParse() method which made additional validation options feasible throughout the project. 
TO enhance the first feature, I also had some fun adding a new property for an illustrative quote for each sales employee - using quotes from the original characters in The Office - because any financial report needs some bling, let's be honest!

## Lessons Learned
This project was our first opportunity to do mob programming. Although it was not easy at first, we learned that we were better for having done it because we benefitted from ideas each of us individually would not have thought of on our own,
because we had to think our own suggestions through more thoroughly since we were asking someone else to do it, and because we had to slow down and be more intentional about the coding process. 


## Project Instructions:
Console Project

> You are an employee of the really awesome cardboard company and you're trying to create a console application for your fellow Sales Team Members. As the Assistant to the Assistant Regional Manager you take it upon yourself to outdo Tim in anyway possible.

> The biggest issue you have is keeping track of your clients and their orders so you can report them back to Michael your overzealous Regional Manager that you do anything for and your secret, cheating ex-girlfriend Accountant, Angelina.

# Implementation Hints:

Create an **Employee** class which will be a base class for **SalesEmployee** & **AccountantEmployee**.

- you should create at least 2 Accountants (Oscar and Kevin are way nicer than Angelina)
- this will allow you *to choose which accountant* you'd like to generate a report for
- **SalesEmployee** class includes a collection of **Sale**

When creating a **Sale**, you should enter all the information pertaining to that sale, and your Name should automatically be populated ( you already entered it in Step 1 ü§Ø )

- note here a class should be made
- create a client # to identify by

Generating a report:

- Iterate over a collection of Sales to give to the chosen Accountant that shows the following:
    1. each **SalesEmployee** and all of their clients
    2. at the end of that employee's clients, show the total sales amount for that month
        1. This can be displayed however you like

One of the menu options states to "Find a Sale", enter a client's # and display that **Sale** with the corresponding saler. 

### ****Keep in mind the application should keep running until you press '5' to exit it....

## Stretch Goals ‚≠ê

Create a projected 3 month report, calculating those sales over the 3 months.
